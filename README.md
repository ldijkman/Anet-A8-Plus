# Anet-A8-Plus 140 Euo 3D printer 300x300x350mm includes shipping dec2020

wil not go that high in Z but the 300x300 is nice

a cheap 3d printer but nice frame design

but would like a belt between z axis to keep them timed/aligned

used a pull spring to tension the extruder axis == broke the printed tensioner
in ols matix printer and plotter they also used spings to tension belts

pitty it can only beep and not play tone sounds like ender3
bit outdated PCB = but no complains for that money

direct replace the shitty linear ball on soft axis for 
first printed pla bus later ordered plastic linear slides
did not want to damage the soft axis with the garbage linear ball slides




2 top plates 8mm tick 1 8mm axis hole only 4mm deep
github renders the stt a bit stange
to lock the z=axis bar instead of the ringlock 

belt block instead of zip ties or is it tys teis i dont know no ty-raps
and belt block for pullspring

cableclip not my design sorry = dont know who
but handy for flat ribbon cable
cable clip fits in aluminium extrusion
